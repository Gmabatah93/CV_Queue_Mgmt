**Sample Video Data:** The primary sample video for MVP development and testing is `bank_sample.MOV`, which simulates customer behavior (including individuals leaving without interacting with a teller) in a bank lobby environment. This video is used to define realistic zone configurations and validate all MVP acceptance criteria.

* **Scene Layout:** The scene is an indoor, well-lit space with a light-colored, speckled floor. There's a distinct blue circular logo on the floor. To the top/top-left of the frame, three red chairs are arranged in a semi-circle, simulating the bank counter/teller interaction zone. The "teller" is presumably located to the left of the chairs, out of frame or at the very edge. The area directly in front of the chairs, extending downwards towards the center of the frame and around the blue logo, appears to be the waiting/line formation zone. People generally enter from the bottom-right and bottom-left edges of the frame and exit towards the bottom-right or top-left.
* **People Behavior:** Typically, 3-5 people are visible at any given time. They tend to walk towards the chairs, some stand near the blue logo, and others sit on the chairs. Line formation is not clear, straight, single-file lines; people stand somewhat loosely, often spaced out, and sometimes wander slightly while waiting. Individuals approach the chairs, and some appear to engage in a transaction or discussion directly in front of them.
* **Abandonment Scenario:** Around the 0:18-0:20 mark, a person in a dark jacket (who was previously standing near the blue logo, possibly in line) moves sharply to the bottom-right edge of the frame and exits, seemingly without having interacted at the chairs. Another person with a green shirt also moves through the scene and exits without clear interaction.
* **Lighting Conditions:** Indoor, generally bright and consistent overhead lighting. There are noticeable light streaks or glare on the floor, originating from the top-right, which could potentially interfere with object detection or tracking.
* **Camera Angle:** Predominantly an overhead, top-down view. This angle is excellent for minimizing occlusions between people, accurate counting of individuals, and easier centroid tracking for zone entry/exit. The perspective makes people appear somewhat "flattened" but their full body is usually visible.
* **Video Duration:** The provided `bank_sample.MOV` is approximately 35-36 seconds long.
* **Resolution/Quality:** The resolution appears to be high-definition (HD), suitable for clear person detection. The quality is good, with sufficient detail for the intended computer vision tasks.
* **Refinement Guidance:**
    * **Line Zone:** Will need to be defined as a polygonal area encompassing the space around the blue logo and extending towards the red chairs, accounting for loose line formation.
    * **Teller Interaction Zone:** A smaller polygonal or rectangular area directly in front of and perhaps slightly including the red chairs.
    * **Detection Thresholds/Business Logic:** The overhead angle is favorable. The presence of floor glare might warrant slight adjustments or testing of the YOLO model's robustness. The "loose" line formation implies that simple bounding box exits aren't enough; centroid must exit the defined line zone and not enter the teller interaction zone within a reasonable timeframe.
    * **Validation:** The specific abandonment instances in the video provide concrete scenarios for testing the "Left Line Without Interaction" logic.
